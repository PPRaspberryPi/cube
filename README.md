## Requirements

Linux (Raspberry Pi):

```
python 3.5
numpy
scipy
inputs
simpleaudio

(pygame for vCube - visualization)
```

## Usage example

You can play snake, pong (single and multiplayer). In addition you can display the current weather state. There is also an inbuilt music player which visualizes the spectrum (via DCT).

I mean, you can play 3D Snake, isn't that enough? ðŸ¤·

## General information

This is just a university project of five guys who decided to have zero free time that semester. Congratulations, you did it. It's NOT meant to be reproduced.

First of all, you would need a 8x8x8 LED cube (which you probably don't have), secondly you would need to have the exact same setup as we have (which you also (probably) do not have).
To sum everything up: you cannot reproduce that (probably).

Why would we put that on GitHub then, you might ask?
> We don't know.

## Contributing

You (probably) can't.
